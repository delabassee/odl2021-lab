# Wrap-up

In this hands-on lab, you have explored some new Java 17 features using the Oracle Cloud.

Given the time constraints and the remote aspect, we did not have the opportunity to necessarily go very deep and cover all the details. Moreover, we had to make a selection and skip some other important new features. For example, we didn't discuss the 2 Project Panama-related APIs present in JDK 17. Covering those at a highlevel would require at another 2h at the very minimum! In a nutshell, there are 2 Panama APIs in JDK 17:
- The [Vector API (2nd incubator)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/414), which enables to easily express vector operations that will be compiled at runtime to be executed on a CPU Vector unit.
- The [Foreign Function & Memory API (Incubator)](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/412), which enables on one hand to access safely and efficiently native memory from Java; and on the other hand to invoke safely native code from Java code.

We haven't discussed any of the underlying HotSpot improvements. We haven't touched the smaller but important enhancements, etc. Each Java release comes with a set of new features, with a lot of various enhancements, and Java 17 is not an exception! 

Today, you have used Helidon simply because it's small, fast, and un-intrusive but there was nothing specific to Helidon. All the features discussed in this lab will work with any frameworks or libraries that support Java 17 (ex. Micronaut).

We hope you have learned something today. The call to action is to download Java 17 right after this lab, and continue your exploration!

For more information on Java 17, and on the Java platform in general, we encourage you to regularly check [Inside Java](https://inside.java), and to follow [@Java](https://twitter.com/java) on Twitter.
